Hotel reservation management system project:

Programming 1's final project.
Completely written in C.

the project is meant to be for hotel staff.

it always saves any changes in the text files: rooms.txt, reservations.txt, users.txt.

when doing a new reservation, it's status is unconfirmed, to confirm the reservation you must check-in first, but you can't check-in if the reservation date is not due yet,

also you can edit a reservation or cancel it, but those can't be done on a confirmed reservation, if you want to cancel or edit, the reservation must be unconfirmed.

after you check in and confirm your reservation, you can check out any time, you can't check out on an unconfirmed reservation.

there's also a query feature... where you can query on any reservation or room in the system.
also there is a menu for reservation report, you provide it with a date and it shows all the reservations checked in on that date.
